Hi,
try to organize your website files, use folders like img, css and js to organise your files
We talked about your website last week, please commit your files regularly, so I can give adequate feedback

Hi,
we spoke yesterday about your html/css and that you need to upgrade it to HTML5.
I'm curious how you're doing, if you commit your progress I'll take another look.
