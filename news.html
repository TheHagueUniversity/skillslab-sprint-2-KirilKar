<h1>+ Twitter introduces QR codes to make following users even easier +</h1>

<h2>New way of being discovered</h2>

<p class="justifiedtext">If searching for a Twitter handle is simply too complicated, you may enjoy the latest solution the popular social network has just launched. Are you a fan of QR codes? Yep, those are now available on Twitter!

You may be familiar with these thanks to Snapchat, another popular social network, which just so happens to use these handy tools.

So, what is this QR code thing? Twitter can create a link between an image and your account, making it easy for others to add you by simply pointing their smartphone cameras at the QR code.
Accessing the QR code options is easy. Simply open the Twitter app, swipe from the left side to pull out your options and select “QR code”. You will then get the option to scan a code, but you can also select “My QR code”. This will create your very own code, which you can take a screenshot of and share away.

That’s it! But we do have to wonder just how helpful this tool is. Is it something you will be using? So far I haven’t even touched the QR codes on Snapchat. I just tell people my username. But hey, hit the comments to let us know if you disagree.</p>

<h1>+ Todoist wants to plan your day with AI-based Smart Schedule +</h1>

<h2>Life hack for our dynamic lives</h2>

<p>Sometimes you don’t feel like making a list and checking it twice (are we right, Santa?) Sometimes you want someone or something to plan your day for you. The popular online list service <strong>Todoist</strong> feels your pain and today launched Smart Schedule, which uses an AI program designed to create a personalized list of daily tasks.
Todoist says that over 70 percent of its users have overdue tasks on their lists, but Smart Schedule has been created to help with that situation. The company says it uses “predictive modeling” to learn what your habits are, along with patterns from other Todoist users, and uses that information to create your optimized task schedule.

For example, if you have a ton of things to do on Thursday, but are free on Friday, Smart Schedule will suggest moving some of those tasks over from one day to the next. Smart Schedule will also estimate the urgency of each of your tasks, based on anonymous data from other Todoist users. Obviously, you can simply ignore the suggestions, or you can accept or edit them as you see fit. Smart Schedule will also learn from experience and, in theory, should offer better personal schedules over time.

Todoist says that the AI program used for Smart Schedule processes your personal data automatically and is not seen by the company’s team members or any outsiders. You can download the latest version of Todoist with the Smart Schedule features now from the Google Play Store.</p>

<h1>+ OnePlus 3T announced: Snapdragon 821, 3400mAh battery, 16MP rear and front cameras +</h1>
<section>
<h2>The affordable exclusivity</h2>
<figure>
<img src="OnePlus-3T.jpg" class="left-positioned-images" alt="OnePLus 3T"><p>Not too long ago (June 2016, to be exact), OnePlus announced its latest controversial flagship smartphone, the OnePlus 3. Featuring an all-metal unibody design, some killer under-the-hood specs and a robust software experience, the OnePlus 3 quickly became one of the better phones in the $400 price range.

As with all smartphones, though, there is plenty of room for improvement, and OnePlus hopes its new flagship will appeal to those who wanted a little more out of the 3.

Enter: OnePlus 3T. With a premium aluminum design, beefed up specifications and affordable price point, the OnePlus 3T aims to be the best in the affordable flagship arena. We’ve got all the specs and details right here, so let’s see what this new device is all about.
As you may have guessed, the OnePlus 3T isn’t all that different from the company’s previous flagship, the OnePlus 3. Rather, the 3T builds off the success of the 3, offering a handful of key hardware and software updates that OnePlus says were “inspired by feedback from the active OnePlus community.”

Perhaps the biggest difference between the 3T and the 3 in terms of design is a new color option. The OnePlus 3T comes in a new Gunmetal color now, as well as a Soft Gold version that will be available shortly after launch.</p></figure>
