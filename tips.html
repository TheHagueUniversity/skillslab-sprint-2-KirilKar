<p class="justifiedtext">Is Instagram so engrossing it is keeping you from having a productive life? Conversely, maybe it’s not good enough or there are certain things in there you would rather live without seeing. Regardless of your position, sometimes it’s better to simply let go of your account. We re here to help you go through the process of deleting your Instagram account.

It’s not too complicated to get rid of your Instagram profile, but there are some things worth noting. First, there are two options for making your Instagram account disappear: You can delete it temporarily or permanently. The main difference is that deleting it permanently will erase all your photos and videos. Suspending it will simply make your data invisible, but all your content will be there when you decide to come back.
How to delete an Instagram account (permanently):
From a browser, go to Instagram’s dedicated page for deleting accounts.
If you are not logged in, you will be asked to do so.
Select your reason for deleting the account.
Re-enter your password.
Select the red button stating: “Permanently delete my account”.
Your account is now gone.</p>

<article>
<p>In the mobile scene, NFC is being marketed as a file-sharing or data-sharing tool. This specific use came to the fore when Google released Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, which also debuted the Android Beam functionality. Through NFC and Android Beam, devices can swap files very quickly to each other. More than that, the presence of NFC on an Android device also allows the same device to read and/or write to programmable NFC tags.
Activating NFC
If your device has NFC, the chip and Android Beam need to be activated so that you can use NFC:

Go to Settings > More.
Tap on the NFC switch to activate it. The Android Beam function will also automatically turn on.
If Android Beam does not automatically turn on, just tap it and select Yes to turn it on.
Smartphones’ NFC capabilities operate in tandem with Android Beam. If Android Beam is disabled, it may limit NFC’s sharing capacity.

Data sharing through NFC
With NFC activated, you already use it for beaming data. For successful data sharing, take note of the following:

Both sending and receiving devices must have NFC and Android Beam activated.
Neither of the devices should be asleep or locked.
You’ll get both audio and haptic feedback when the two devices detect each other.
Do not separate your devices until the beaming has started.
You’ll hear audio feedback when the file or content has been successfully beamed.

<img src="galaxy.jpg" class="left"><p>Taking a screenshot can be quite helpful in many ways. If you need to share something on your screen with someone but they aren’t next to you, sending them a screenshot is a handy way to do so.

If you own a Galaxy Note 7 and are wondering how to take a screenshot, look no further! Taking a screenshot on the Galaxy Note 7 is very easy, and there are three methods to do so:

Method 1 — the easiest way:

Pull up the page on your Galaxy Note 7 that you want to screenshot.
Press and hold the power button and the home button for two seconds.
A brief flash will appear, along with a notification, at which point you can release both buttons.
Method 2 — the palm swipe screenshot:

Pull up the page on your Galaxy Note 7 that you want to screenshot.
Place your hand along either edge of the Galaxy Note 7 and swipe in from the edge.
A brief flash will appear, along with a notification.
If this method did not work, go to Settings, then Advanced features, and make sure Palm swipe to capture is turned on. 
Method 3 — the Screen Write screenshot:

Make sure the content you want to take a screenshot of is open.
Take out your S Pen and tap on Screen Write once the Air Command menu has launched.
A brief flash will appear.
You can now draw on the screenshot with your S Pen with different colors, an eraser, and more.
When you’re done, tap on Crop, Share, or Save.</p></figure>
