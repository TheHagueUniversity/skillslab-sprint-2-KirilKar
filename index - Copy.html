<div class="Image"><img src ="tt.jpg" width="410" height="330" align="left"><font size=5 color=grey>We’ve all enjoyed the simple benefits of Google’s artificial intelligence photo recognition. Google Photos employs a very stripped down version of the algorithm to identify pictures as containing cats, dogs, food, or specific people. However, the search giant has been working on much more advanced photo recognition capabilities, and today they’ve released their progress to developers.
The Google Research Blog reports that the Google Brain team’s AI image captioning system has achieved a 93.9 percent accuracy rating. Their results in 2014 used the Inception V1 image classification model and achieved 89.6 percent accuracy. This might not seem like a vast improvement, but when it comes to emulating natural human language activity, such as captioning a photo, the curve becomes quite steep.</font></div>

<div class="Opera"><font size=5 color=grey align="justify">The VPN-ready Opera browser for Android is receiving an update that should make the user experience a whole lot more modern and fresh, not to mention in line with Google’s Material Design. As the Norwegian company put it, it’s a “serious lick of paint.”

Changes in the design of Opera’s start page abound: the familiar Speed Dial has a new home on the leftmost screen of the carousel. Swiping to the right will take you through a news feed that you can customize to include information you care about. Adding and removing topics can be done by tapping the “+” icon on the right. You can also access “reader mode” from here.

The bottom navigation bar has been redesigned. To the right of the bar, you’ll find a “person” icon that gives you access to offline pages, bookmarks, history and downloads. If you decide to sign in, you’ll be able to synchronize your Speed Dial, bookmarks, tabs and history across multiple devices.</font></div>

<div class="Image1"><img src="mmn.jpg" width="350" height="300" align="left"><font size=5 color=grey align="justify">If Google Glass isn’t quite your thing, you might find Snapchat’s new camera-equipped glasses a bit more fun to wear, once they hit the shelves this fall for $130.

CEO Evan Spiegel just took the wraps off Spectacles, the first wearable from Snapchat and the company’s first foray into hardware since its founding five years ago. The product, which looks a lot like a pair of regular sunglasses, first showed up in a video leaked by Business Insider, and Snapchat was quick to confirm that the rumor was real.

Spectacles is designed to record 10-second videos captured with a fish-eye lens. Just tap a button near the glasses’ hinge and you can start recording videos in a circular format that is supposed to simulate a human’s field of view.

More specifically, Spectacles captures videos in a 115-degree field of view, setting it apart from typical mobile cameras and action cams already out in the market. You can sync the glasses with your mobile device to quickly share your “memories,” preferably over Snapchat, of course.</font></div>
