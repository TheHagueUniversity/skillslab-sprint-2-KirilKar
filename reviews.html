<p class="justifiedtext">The Google Pixel is a landmark device, signalling the first proper foray into phones by the search engine giant. And boy, has it done a good job.
The Pixel is available in two sizes – the smaller one reviewed here and a larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL – and has one of the best cameras on any phone, along with a software experience that's better than any other Android device.
You have to pay a premium for these features – this certainly isn’t a Nexus-priced device – but it’s far from the first phone to cost a pretty penny. And when it’s this good, it’s worth paying that bit extra.
Unlike Apple, Google includes a 3.5mm headphone jack – but I’d have preferred for it to have been placed at the bottom rather than the top of the phone. In addition, Google has used a wide bezel above and below the screen – just like the iPhone. It would have been good to see this space used for a pair of front-facing speakers – maybe this will come with the Pixel 2.
The sides are heavily chamfered, and this helps the device to fit comfortably in your hand. This is one of the easiest phones to hold, helped by the fact it isn’t overly thin.
It’s also completely usable in one hand, something that can’t be said for the larger Pixel XL. It’s roughly the same size as an iPhone 7, just a little taller and marginally thicker.

<h1>++ Google Pixel - Display ++</h1>

<h2>Ultra-class technology</h2>

<p>5-inch displays are becoming a rarity in the Android space, but for many they provide the perfect mix of portability and size. However, the problem – aside from the dearth of choice – is that smaller phones tend to be hamstrung by weak components and a lack of features.
Thankfully, this isn’t the case here. This is a 5-inch display phone with the innards of a larger device – and that’s great news.
The Pixel's display is fantastic, comfortably one of the best at this size. It’s an <strong>AMOLED</strong> panel – the same tech Samsung uses on its Galaxy series – with a 1080p resolution. This isn't as high as the larger Pixel XL and its quad-HD panel, but due to its smaller size you really won’t notice the difference.
It’s pin-sharp with zero jagged edges around icons when you’re looking at it from a normal distance. Get right up close, with your eye almost touching the screen, and you might notice a tiny bit of pixellation around the battery icons and on-screen buttons. Realistically, though, you won't be using the phone from such a distance.

<h1>+++ Google Pixel - Performance +++</h1>
<section>
<h2>Biggest strength of the phone</h2>
<figure>
<img src="Google-Pixel-Performance.jpg" class="left-positioned-images" alt="Facts about performance"><p>
The Google Pixel is a seriously fast phone, probably the snappiest Android handset on the market for general use – and even creeping up on the iPhone 7.
Part of this is clearly down to the combination of the Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB of RAM, but the real success here is a result of how it's all been optimised.
The Samsung Galaxy S7 is fast, as is the HTC 10 and OnePlus 3 with its 6GB of RAM, but random slowdown and strange behaviour is still commonplace in all those handsets. This isn’t the case with the Google Pixel: from opening apps, to scrolling through Chrome and playing games, it just feels right. It feels like it should; it feels like an iPhone.
It’s just another nail in the coffin of the traditional benchmark tool, as in most areas it falls behind the competition it actually bests. In Geekbench 4 its 4,079 multi-core score falls short of the Samsung Galaxy S7’s 5,481, while in 3D Mark’s IceStorm Unlimited the Pixel’s 27,453 can’t match the iPhone 7's 37,349.
